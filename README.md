# Game of Life

A Next.js application deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to your repository settings
3. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
4. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
5. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file will handle the deployment automatically

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The app uses a modern GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Builds the Next.js application with static export
- Uses GitHub's official Pages deployment action
- Includes proper caching and error handling
- Supports both `main` and `master` branches

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
