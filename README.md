### 3D Navigation
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the view
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Right Click + Drag**: Pan the view

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with static site generation
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library for WebGL rendering
- **@react-three/drei**: Essential helpers and components for React Three Fiber

# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

## üìä 3D Game of Life Rules

This implementation extends Conway's classic 2D Game of Life to three dimensions:

- **Neighborhood**: Each cell has 26 neighbors (3√ó3√ó3 cube minus the center)
- **Birth Rule**: A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly N neighbors (configurable, default: 5)
- **Survival Rule**: A live cell survives if it has between Min and Max neighbors (configurable, default: 4-6)
- **Boundaries**: Periodic (toroidal) - cells on edges wrap around to the opposite side

### Visual Design
- **Age-based Coloring**: Cells change color based on how long they've been alive
- **Smooth Transitions**: Dead cells fade out gradually for better visual continuity
- **Instanced Rendering**: Optimized performance for large grids using Three.js instanced meshes

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automatic)

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles deployment automatically

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and export static files
npm run build

# Deploy the 'out' directory to your hosting service
```
